# wor-scopes
Metadata for wor-scopes collection

metadata was pulled from UTKcataloging and the identifier
for the admindb was used to rename the files.

The Omeka id was also dropped.

## Additional Updates ##
* Added an oXygen Project (`wor-scopes.xpr`).
* Added an identity transform that updates the `/mods/relatedItem[@type='host'][@displayLabel='Project']/titleInfo/title` to "Of Monkeys and Men: Public and Private Views from the Scopes Trial".
* Added an `output/` directory for files coming out of the identity transform.
